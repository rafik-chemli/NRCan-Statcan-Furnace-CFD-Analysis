CFD Data Exploration and Modeling of Bio-Particles in Industrial Steel Furnaces aiming to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions

In a joint effort between Natural Resources Canada (NRCan) and Statistics Canada, the primary goal of the collaboration was to leverage NRCan's comprehensive furnace datasets for advanced analytics to identify the best conditions for introducing bio-particles in arc steel furnaces, reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
